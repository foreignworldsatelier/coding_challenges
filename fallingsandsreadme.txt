To run the Falling Sand Simulation, use both the fallingsandsumlation and the fallingsandsimulationdisplay files. 
Make sure they are in the same folder in your IDE. When you run fallingsandsimulation a window will open. Click in the window to drop simulated sand particles.
Select a different particle using the buttons in the display, try different combinations!
