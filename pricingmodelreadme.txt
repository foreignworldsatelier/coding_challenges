Read me: This model utilizes various python libraries to build a predictive pricing model using a 3 pronged approach.
1)Determine sunk costs by making assumptions for base pay for the employees that will be working on the project, how many hours each phase of the project will take, and the the overhead associated with running a business. 2)Compare sunk cost and quality of product to the market as well as determine what a good quality to cost ratio would be. Different markets/products would require different analyses but that's the one shown here. 3) Project the analysis into the future to show how pricing and profits could change over time given certain market conditions, business growth, and inflation.
Additional analyses to consider:
-Convert market share to number of transactions to better size the price vs cost and growth
-Allow for multiple project types with size variance, etc
-Include material classes/ lead time etc for physical products
-Include multiple revenue streams
-Include additional market conditions in the forecast
